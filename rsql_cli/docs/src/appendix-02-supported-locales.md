## Supported Locales

Each locale code combines an [ISO 639-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code) language code and an
[ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country code to specify language and regional
settings.

The following locales have translations available for use. Most of the translations are "machine translations" are will
often be less than perfect. If you would like to contribute a better translation, or add a new locale, please submit
your contribution to [rsql](https://github.com/theseus-rs/rsql).

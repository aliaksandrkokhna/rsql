## Installation

To install rsql, navigate to the [RSQL](https://theseus-rs.github.io/rsql/rsql_cli/) site and select an installation
method. If you are attempting to install on platform not listed on that page, you can find builds for other platforms
on the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/theseus-rs/rsql/releases) or downlad and build from source.

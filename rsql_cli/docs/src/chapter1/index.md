# Getting Started

Welcome to the rsql quick start guide! This section will help you install rsql, run your first query, and learn best
practices for using the CLI efficiently.

## Quick Start

1. **Install rsql**
    - See the [Installation](./installation.md) section for platform-specific instructions.
2. **Run your first query**
    - Try a simple query against a supported database or file. See [First Query](./first-query.md) for examples.
3. **Explore configuration**
    - Customize rsql using the `rsql.toml` file. See the [Configuration File](../appendix/rsql-toml.md) appendix for
      details.
4. **Set your locale**
    - Use the `.locale` command to set your preferred language and number formatting.
      See [Supported Locales](../appendix/supported-locales.md).

## Best Practices

- **Leverage command history and smart completions** to speed up interactive work.
- **Use output formats** (CSV, JSON, Markdown, etc.) to integrate with other tools or reporting workflows.
- **Check the [FAQ & Tips](../appendix/index.md#faq--tips--tricks)** for troubleshooting and advanced usage.

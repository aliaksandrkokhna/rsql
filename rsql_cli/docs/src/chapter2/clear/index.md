## clear

The `.clear` command clears the terminal screen, providing a clean workspace. This is especially useful during long
interactive sessions or when you want to remove clutter from previous outputs.

### Usage

```text
.clear
```

### When to use

- Use `.clear` to reset your terminal view before running new queries or demos.
- Helpful for presentations or screen recordings.

### Examples

Clear the screen:

```text
.clear
```

### Troubleshooting

- If the screen does not clear, ensure your terminal supports ANSI escape codes.
- On some platforms, the effect may vary depending on the terminal emulator.

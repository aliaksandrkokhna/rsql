# Commands

Commands are the primary way to interact with the rsql CLI. A command is a single word that is used
to perform a specific action preceded by the command identifier (eg: `.help`). The commands are
localized for each supported language. A shortened version of the command can be used as long as it
is unique. For example, `.desc` can be used in place of `.describe`.
